Analysis


Based on the data from 2019, I wanted to generate a plot that compares the beginning of the year (January 2019) to the end of the year (December 2019). In both dashboards, I analyzed the start and end locations for both months and looked at popular locations by gender. Based on the map, I have observed a cluster of popular locations in downtown Jersey City. Interestingly, the most active starting locations are also among the most active ending locations, with Grove St Path being the most active overall. Additionally, I have examined gender-based patterns and identified the most popular station among each gender.

However, I did encounter a setback regarding the trip duration. When I cleaned my data, it was saved in a year format, which limited my ability to conduct the desired analysis.
